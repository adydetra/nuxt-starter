## Commit Rules

- feat: Short for "feature," this prefix is used when introducing a new feature or functionality to the codebase.
- chore: This prefix is used for commits related to maintenance tasks, build processes, or other non-user-facing changes. It typically includes tasks that don't directly impact the functionality but are necessary for the project's development and maintenance.
- fix: Used when addressing a bug or issue in the codebase. This prefix indicates that the commit contains a fix for a problem.
- docs: Used when making changes to documentation, including comments in the code, README files, or any other documentation associated with the project.
- style: This prefix is used for code style changes, such as formatting, indentation, and whitespace adjustments.
- refactor: Used when making changes to the codebase that do not introduce new features or fix issues but involve restructuring or optimizing existing code.
- test: Used when adding or modifying tests for the codebase, including unit tests, integration tests, and other forms of testing.
